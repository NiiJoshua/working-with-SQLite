# Working-with-SQLite

If you desire to have a local database to work with or explore, SQLlite is perhaps your best option. Working with SQLite does not require connection to a server or a remote database. 
My first experience was quite amazing. I have shared the jupyter notebook I used to for this practice using python. Access this mimi course from Real Python from [this link](https://realpython.com/python-sql-libraries/#understanding-the-database-schema). It also includes workig with Postgress and MySQL
